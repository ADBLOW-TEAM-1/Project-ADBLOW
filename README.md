# Project A.D.B.L.O.W. (anti-dont-be-late-for-work)

## Description 

This project will get the users current position and show them an interactive map with traffic flow and pop-up boxes for any incidents in the area. This is used to help the user make better decisions when deciding a route to work. It will also display the current weather conditions to aid with that decision.

## How to use
